- todo
  - generics
  - real overload resolution involving types
  - interface auto-conversion and checking
  - automatic operator conversion so += can map to = and + if += isn't defined
  - throw/try/catch/finally
  - js generation
  - c++ generation
  - base classes
    - calling base class methods with "super"
    - support for protected access level
  - annotations
  - compile-time constants
  - top-level if statements instead of c-style preprocessor, conditions must be constants and are evaluated from the outside in
  - inlining
  - automatic renaming, especially important for overloaded functions
    - could probably get by with just @rename for quite a while
  - lambda conversion to classes
  - abstract functions/types
  - import/export
  - standard library
  - bootstrap the compiler
  - alias types using the "type" declaration prefix, not available inside functions?
  - namespace imports via the "use" declaration prefix
  - do [list] and {initializer} expressions, require argument-less "new" and use [...] and {...} as operator names for appending
    - {...} can take one argument or two arguments using ":" as a separator

x done
  x need errors for ambiguous overloads at initialization time
  x make "self" explicit inside the compiler for sanity (all instance member NAME nodes become DOT nodes)
  x comment parsing inside functions
  x argument type checking
  x return type and presence checking
  x function types including calling values of those types
  x lambda argument types from type context
  x deduplicate lambda types so equivalence checks using equality work






class Foo<T> {
  var foo T // need an error here, can't just use null
}
